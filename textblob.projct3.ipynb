    "**Purpose**: This Python script reads previously analyzed sentiment data from a CSV file into a DataFrame or initializes an empty DataFrame if the file doesn't exist. It then prompts the user to input text for sentiment analysis, continuously analyzing sentiment until the user types \"quit.\" After each input, it updates the DataFrame with the text and its sentiment, displays the updated DataFrame, and saves it to a CSV file before exiting. This code enables ongoing sentiment analysis of user-provided text data with easy tracking of sentiment trends over time.\n"
